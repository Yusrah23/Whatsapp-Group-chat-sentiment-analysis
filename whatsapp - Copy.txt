[05/07/2022, 21:33:32] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: It should never be .
Python is extremely important to a data scientist, data analyst, data engineer etc. .. .
[05/07/2022, 21:34:01] Abu Waqqaas SH: Infact, my own next tool on the agenda is SPSS and SQL  also
[05/07/2022, 21:34:13] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Please briefly explain the difference between these categories of data
[05/07/2022, 21:34:53] ‪+237 6 94 79 75 16‬: Good evening to everyone
[05/07/2022, 21:35:32] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: Ok...
[05/07/2022, 21:35:46] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: In summary,  the movement is like this 

Data Engineers provide the raw data and makes it available for a data analyst.

A data analyst uses the ETL process to wrangle the data and make it insightful. 

Then a Data scientist pics the insightful already analysed data and uses machine learning (supervised, unsupervised,  etc...),  algorithms to predict and make forecasts from the data by developing models. 

Then a business analyst or business intelligence analyst uses the predicted data from the data scientists to make profit yielding decisions to businesses. 


ETL process means Extraction, Transformation and Loading.
[05/07/2022, 21:35:59] ‪+237 6 94 79 75 16‬: Are we going to organise the classes here?
[05/07/2022, 21:38:37] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: So creating data on a CSV file and trying to get information from that CSV file using either Python or R falls under what category?
[05/07/2022, 21:40:49] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: It depends on your aim with the project. 

This is applicable to data ecosystem generally,  you won't stop hearing,  Csv, json, Tsv etc....
[05/07/2022, 21:41:53] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: I must say that everyone can help out on anything in the group,  please don't leave it all to admin..🤣

Thank you
[05/07/2022, 21:43:31] ‪+234 813 682 2737‬: Good to know. People should avoid unnecessary grandiose also.
[05/07/2022, 21:43:51] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: The data analyst
[05/07/2022, 21:44:10] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: And data engineer. Depending on the company
[05/07/2022, 21:44:22] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: Please break down grandiose😅
[05/07/2022, 21:44:28] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: I work a lot with CSV files, I don't understand tsv yet
[05/07/2022, 21:44:48] ‪+234 703 804 9427‬: So glad to be here...
Good evening 🙌🫣
[05/07/2022, 21:44:49] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: The data engineer can handle big loads of data and store them in a database. Then the data analyst can just collect what he or she needs for his analysis. That's why they need to learn SQL I guess
[05/07/2022, 21:45:20] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Data analyst and Data engineer seems mixed
[05/07/2022, 21:45:43] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Titanic database falls under what category?
[05/07/2022, 21:45:44] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: Not really. It's just that small companies expect the data analyst to do the work of data engineers too
[05/07/2022, 21:45:56] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Headaches 😕
[05/07/2022, 21:46:16] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: They are very different
[05/07/2022, 21:46:50] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Where does machine learning come into here?
[05/07/2022, 21:47:15] ‪+234 813 682 2737‬: For newbies who are not sure of their whereabouts. It's Excel/SPSS and R/Python.
They are similar each pair are almost equally powerful
[05/07/2022, 21:47:35] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: They say don't speak grandiose and you're asking me about titanic😂

Then you can create folders in your repository and add any extra thing you want to add

[05/07/2022, 22:02:32] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: One hour video I mean😂
[05/07/2022, 22:02:48] ‪+234 906 437 4166‬: Omoh, no yawa! U can send. I will bore it too😅
[05/07/2022, 22:03:02] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Python is a must have for data scientists...
R is a must not neglect for both analysts and scientists

Both are powerful...
[05/07/2022, 22:03:14] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: But which wud u recommend to a newbie
[05/07/2022, 22:03:44] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Understand Database management first

[05/07/2022, 22:08:05] ‪+234 806 394 9391‬: We need virtual tutorial session please
[05/07/2022, 22:10:21] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: If you understand Database management and then Statistics include domain knowledge

Programming shouldn't be hard for you
[05/07/2022, 22:11:26] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Someone should please suggest?
[05/07/2022, 22:11:36] ‪+234 813 238 5286‬: I would suggest a newbie in this field, data science et analytics, should consider Coursera for a start. And you can from there strt nd continue learning using other means and all.
If you can’t afford some of the courses, there is financial aid that will be reviewed over 15 days, and trust me, you will get it. 
Some courses are event certified

[06/07/2022, 10:13:43] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: R can comfortably do both😌
[06/07/2022, 10:25:27] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: I don't think it's right to argue on what tools to learn and what not to learn. It's confusing people

You can't tell someone not to learn tableau because R can do same thing
[06/07/2022, 10:26:41] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: If a company wants to hire you and tell you that you must know tableau and you tell them that you can do it with R, they won't even look at your face. Me sef that's employer will not listen to you
[06/07/2022, 10:27:19] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: I've seen various roadmaps and they also mention these tools for data analysts

Excel
SQL
PowerBI or Tableau (learn one first)
Python
[06/07/2022, 10:27:22] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: Most of them are in this order
[06/07/2022, 10:28:18] ‪+234 802 734 9606‬: On point
[06/07/2022, 10:41:54] ‪+234 903 451 9958‬: In summary, be versatile but master one

[06/07/2022, 10:44:38] ‪+234 903 451 9958‬: ✅
[06/07/2022, 10:46:56] Olaoluwa DS: They can forgive you if you don't know R or python. It is assumed you don't like coding. But your sins will not be forgiven if you don't know those visualization tools😉. Or better still stick with machine learning alone.

Solve real life issues and document all your projects,  two things will always be requested when applying for a job in the data ecosystem. 

1. Expertise in your field
2. Portfolio to show for what you professed to be good at

Learn, re learn ,and keep building your portfolio 👍

More reason they are luring people into it; is to see how far individuals can discover things. As the top experts are finding out things they want others to keep using the tools. Machine learning will eventually bring about the end of everything, scary but the truth.

[07/07/2022, 05:14:17] ‪+234 906 706 8802‬: Argumentative writing is a crucial skill for success. It fosters critical thinking and civic engagement. You can strengthen this skill with practice, but unfortunately, most students don't get a chance to receive the consistent feedback needed to improve. Your data science skills could provide automated support to give students more training in argumentative writing. 

The goal of this competition is to classify argumentative elements in student writing as "effective," "adequate," or "ineffective." You will create a model trained on data that is representative of the 6th-12th grade population in the United States in order to minimize bias. The competition comprises two tracks: an Efficiency Prize ($30,000) and the traditional Leaderboard Prize ($25,000).

Total Prizes:
$55,000

Entry Deadline:
August 16, 2022

[08/07/2022, 15:30:50] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: Good evening everyone,  I noticed  some persons are exiting the group,  have had little conversation with a few persons that left and I feel so bad that people who really say they want to be very good data scientists ,data analysts, data engineers etc..  have to leave a group like this because they feel they have not yet gotten to the level others have gotten to and they probably don't understand all the discussions of Machine learning, deep learning etc.

The best way to learn is to stay in the circle of people who have gone past you and have what you do not have, please nobody should feel inferior about what you know now, with time you will be wowed at what you will know tomorrow...

Your little connection can take you up there in just a second. 

You can't run away for meeting people who have ADVANCED in a filed, even when you start working in an office they will always be there 👌

But there is room for growth from a stage to another. 

That is why even companies send out their workers and pay for them to go and level up in some skill areas

I might not be so free to chat anyone up as to why they left again, that's why I am saying this to us all...

You can't know everything, you can't learn alone, you can't be all you wanna be just immediately,  if the discussion is too above your current knowledge, don't worry, stay there, learn from others. 

You will be much better with time.

[08/07/2022, 15:47:25] ‪+234 814 272 6181‬: You're very right sir. And I'm glad you chatted with some of those who exited.

But the truth is, if there is a mixture of people here, who know about data, novice, basic, intermediate or advanced, there'll be issues like this when we don't use this opportunity well. When the basic class people don't benefit from what is been discussed. 

I'd suggest that, since the purpose of this group is to educate people, the admin should try and outline probably a syllabus, or list of softwares for data analysis, where per week, or month or even days, we can talk or discuss about one tool at a time. People can even volunteer to teach we learner's. You never can tell, starting stuffs like this, can help a lot of people now and later. A community than this can even be built. That's the power of network.

The truth is, if this group is left this way, some of us may not benefit at all. For me, I'm still here cos I don't exit groups very quick, but I tell you, I rarely read what is dropped here, cos it's way beyond my level, machine language🥹, when I'm still trying to learn tableau...

Ejor, let's optimize this group it it will really impact lives. 🙏🏼

I love data analysis oo😁💝💝

[08/07/2022, 16:19:53] Olaoluwa DS: **Most Common tools**
Powerbi 
Excel
_SQL (maybe needful as you may have to extract data from database)_

**Advanced tools**
Python
R
SQL and NoSQL
[08/07/2022, 16:20:04] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: Yeah, 

I just feel most times we look at people's conversation or progress and feel we are not doing anything at all. 

It should be a source of motivation. Starr the discussion, download the images or the pdf they are discussing about. 

Engage. Even if na just to dey laugh. Keep laughing. 

Go back and study on your own. Map your own progress while trying to close the gap between their own knowledge and yours. 

Make friends with people in any group you find yourself it also helps. 

Don't forget the keep moving no matter what aspect. Nothing is easy, choose your easy and enjoy later.

Please anyone that has reported findings base an data analysis should share links of their story format to me...
[08/07/2022, 16:26:28] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: If this is the reason they left, it's really surprising. 

What will now happen to me that is surrounded by experts in the field?🙆🏼‍♂️

Even when they drop teachings on their status, I reply to ask questions if I don't understand. 

Even if you can't ask questions here, send a DM to the person and ask questions. 

That's how we learn. Even as analysts and scientists, if you don't ask questions to your data, your model or insights won't go well🥴

Downloading PDFs and studying by self is a good one, but does not work for everyone.
I've never worked on machine language, how on Earth will I study it Alone😁

But Sha, messages are always too much sef. Everyone is dropping new and Different things the same time. 😭😭

You see that machine learning? I ran. But I go still go back when it's time. 

One thing with the data space is there's so much to learn. It can be overwhelming. Just learn to filter but don't feel intimidated.

Before I would try to consume everything but at some point, I had to call myself back and say Wo! Don't kill yourself. Choose few and leave the rest. As time advances, you'll meet those rest you left behind before

For those who were asking, this is the most recommended machine learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng (co founder of Coursera and former head of Google's machine learning team)
[08/07/2022, 17:00:02] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: I think there should be an updated version of the course which was released this year...
[08/07/2022, 17:00:20] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: I'll send it across once I find it. But in the mean time, that course is all you need to get into machine learning

Me sef ma learner I be, but I did one thing which was go give myself a personal timeline. I realized that I was competing only with myself and not with others. So what others have learnt shouldn't affect me so long as I keep improving on myself too!!!

But as of today, people like me wey be coconut head cam easily jump in without any form of prior skill and still be able to pick up🙌🏿
[08/07/2022, 17:06:43] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: You don minit😃
[08/07/2022, 17:07:20] Olaoluwa DS: Don't apply for this course yet if you want to apply for the google bootcamp.
[08/07/2022, 17:07:56] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: Yes ooo... Important disclaimer!!
[08/07/2022, 17:07:58] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: People still complain that Machine learning JD still has that masters requirement. 

And some data scientist roles too
[08/07/2022, 17:08:07] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: It's exactly the same course that you will be learning during the Google bootcamp
[08/07/2022, 17:09:05] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: True talk... They still do
[08/07/2022, 17:09:30] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: For now, only analyst roles no longer have restrictions. For scientist roles and core ML roles, you *may* still be required to provide a degree
[08/07/2022, 17:10:44] Olaoluwa DS: Yes it does. But if you are good at it. They will hire you with a very good pay. They request for masters and higher degree because of the  in-depth knowledge of statistics and logic needed in machine learning.
[08/07/2022, 17:10:44] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: Though that shouldn't stop you from applying, coz foreign companies will altimately choose you of you have projects to back yourself up
[08/07/2022, 17:11:33] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: I think where this will win is if someone refers you. But if it's direct application, the possibility is very minimal
[08/07/2022, 17:12:10] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: Also, a hack that I have seen people use is that they first target analyst roles within a company, then once they have gotten employed as analysts, they start working towards joining the data science team of the same company. That way, there won't be much of a bottle neck
[08/07/2022, 17:12:38] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: Yes. That's actually my plan 😅
[08/07/2022, 17:13:12] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: True. But the good news is that even google is currently having a rethink on that policy. Hence why they brought up that machine learning bootcamp 😹
[08/07/2022, 17:14:25] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: I would advice everyone who is aiming for data science to avail themselves of this opportunity and apply for that bootcamp, if not this cohort then next year's cohort

[08/07/2022, 17:19:00] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: Though, that shouldn't discourage anyone
[08/07/2022, 17:19:57] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: All it takes is a good knowledge of python

[08/07/2022, 17:20:00] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: So try and brush up on your python before you take the entrance quizz, you will do just fine

[08/07/2022, 17:28:10] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: Do you mind telling us the questions you were asked boss?
[08/07/2022, 17:33:49] Olaoluwa DS: They asked for every piece of my info. Their aim is to ensure you are getting a job after the training. If you are not taking the program to quit your job, you will be denied. They requested my social account, and I am currently running a study. If they take that into account, I cannot be working and schooling at the same time. Hope you get. I pray it doesn't count against me
[08/07/2022, 17:34:28] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: Omooo
[08/07/2022, 17:34:55] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: That means they actually have potential employment opportunities for people who graduate from the boot camp
[08/07/2022, 17:35:25] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: I suspected as much...with the way they packaged it
[08/07/2022, 17:35:55] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: I pray you get in boss... At least make you dey give us insider information pending when e go reach our turn 😁
[08/07/2022, 17:35:55] Olaoluwa DS: Yeah if you can finish the bootcamp. It's a very advanced program. They will mentor you until you get the job.
[08/07/2022, 17:36:51] Olaoluwa DS: Amen o. 🙏🏽

[08/07/2022, 17:38:57] Olaoluwa DS: I explained my situation though. I pray it works
[08/07/2022, 17:55:21] Olaoluwa DS: **How to learn tools faster**
One major secret to learning tools faster is to aim for foundation and basic principles( don't just jump to powerbi, learn excel first.). Just like learning to write a machine learning code is not as demanding as the statistics and logic behind a good model(what is the essence of training a model that is not accurate?🙄).
Most people who have been using excel are awesome data analysts. They are familiar with doing complicated tasks with a basic tool, and so transferring knowledge to an advanced tool becomes easier. There are similar terminologies in most tools, especially in tech. A very good example is datatypes. Many people don't understand what data types are 😲. If you are one of them, please go back and study. Read to understand.

When learning python or a high-level programming language (hope you know excel helps in this regard, ask me later😔), don't run from the basics and don't spend too much time on basics. I have worked with a senior developer and I have to be the one to explain the concept of a code in another programming language (imagine!) So keep pushing!.

You can't learn everything in a day so start handling projects as this will challenge you and help you learn faster
Don't be too serious, have fun. Your brain may be overworking. So relax! 

Lastly, you should have a cheat sheet ( you will have to pay me to explain😜😜😜 #joking.)


*What not to do when learning*

* Don't memorize every syntax. Google is always your friend and that's the more reason for a cheatsheet
* Don't try to understand everything, just follow the tutorial or instructor.
* You don't have to learn every tool. Focus on your strengths, but you can learn concepts from others.
* Don't be driven by money. Learn the skills, money will surely come in this field(100%).

[10/07/2022, 16:15:06] ‪+234 903 451 9958‬: Ok
[10/07/2022, 16:16:45] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: Step 1.
Go to your settings , then go to options and security,  then look for a feature called map visuals and enable it

Step 2
Log in to POWERBI service with your Microsoft 365 developer account. 

Then while on POWERBI service,  at the top right corner you will see three dots, put your cursor there , then over your cursor on settings, immediately you put your cursor on settings you will see "admin portal"

Click on that admin portal, then you will see a lot of things you need to enable. 

So enable everything that has to do with map visuals 

After all these steps then close your POWERBI desktop and restart it again. 

It will work
[10/07/2022, 16:37:57] ‪+234 903 451 9958‬: It worked, thanks 👍🏼

[11/07/2022, 11:28:30] ‪+234 706 473 0879‬: The Intelligence behind the artificial intelligence should be far far superior. Something that births another is greater than that thing. They might be similar but human Intelligence can never be compared to AI
[11/07/2022, 11:29:07] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: The understanding of the inner workings of the human  mind is the key to makung artificial intelligence comparable to human intelligence.
The major challange has always been how to make machines think the way humans would, so the approach that has been adopted thus far is like that adopted when teaching a human child. i.e. using experiences to model a learning path for the child (someone may say that this is basically ML) but that child does not stay a child forever. Growing up, it now realises his power of self thought and given the complexity of the human mind is able to break out of the model he was taught while a child and introduce an entirely different mthd of handling an issue.
This here is the gap btw human and artificial intelligence. So the child can think on his own and not depend on past experiences to solve an issue but the AI accesses its ML model, searches the net and makes suggestions or "decisions" as per previous experiences which is "limited" unlike that of the human mind.

My conclusion, until the mystery of the human mind is cracked, the infinite possilities explored, I *dont* think Human Intelligence can be compared to AI.
😁...

[11/07/2022, 11:40:51] ‪+234 807 486 4438‬: I agree to disagree
AI cannot be compared to Human Intelligence cause AI is typically the gathering of smart and advanced Humans so they create a very intelligent AI


Without the Human Intelligence, AI would not exist
So AI cannot be compared to Human Intelligence

Though AI can do the works that Humans can't
But Human will always be superior to AI
[11/07/2022, 11:41:58] Olaoluwa DS: Hmmmmm
[11/07/2022, 11:41:59] Olaoluwa DS: Hmmmm
[11/07/2022, 11:44:40] Olaoluwa DS: I will have to reserve my comment as regards this because even Mark and Ellon have different views. Some people are more logical and my thought process and understanding of BIA(biological artificial intelligence). BIA will grow into having its own consciousness, the question is what is the mind?
[11/07/2022, 11:51:39] ‪+234 813 238 5286‬: I totally agree to this. 
Because without humans, there will not be AI. AI works based on the gathered experience by human beings.
It can be trained to be smart as we all know AI are wey smart, but I do not think they can beat human intelligence
[11/07/2022, 11:53:16] ‪+234 807 486 4438‬: Exactly what I stated above👌👌

Abeg thinkers in my CL, I have a question for you. 

If two cities have 11% and 3% of prostitution percentages respectively and then other cities have just less than 1.5%, which city would you investigate?🤔

I'm thinking of those two cities but then those two cities don't have upto 50% of the population. It's just 14% total out of 100%, which is so low. 

What do you guys think?

[13/07/2022, 05:37:01] Olaoluwa DS: And it does. As the AI interacts , that interaction is also a form of data source. And it learns how not to perform on the go. Just like you learn on the job and like google Maps is collecting data as you drive. Until you shut down the internet or the AI, it will always have access to data. People talk every day and siri is listening, the backend guys have decided not to unleash the true capabilities of siri, else you will be scared of it.
[13/07/2022, 05:39:08] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Hmm true capabilities of Siri
[13/07/2022, 05:41:55] Olaoluwa DS: If an AI starts playing chess with you, it will learn your strategies, if it's backed by strong reward function, it will beat you after few games. It will develop a strategy you are not even aware of.😜

[13/07/2022, 05:44:45] Olaoluwa DS: It actually doesn't need game theory. It is just studying patterns difficult for you to see. And I am rewarding it in the code i wrote to learn to win

[13/07/2022, 06:14:05] ‪+234 902 604 9172‬: Firstly to me, its about two things: perspective and priority.. Perspective In the sense that how do Nigerians view the effectiveness of AI in handling health issues.. Are Nigerians even educated on the vast benefits of the AI let alone put their health issues in its hands... The second being priority.. Nigeria has a whole lot of misplaced priorities.. Obviously technological advancement vis a vis AI at that period wouldn't even come to the minds of Nigerians due to lack of enlightenment and exposure
[13/07/2022, 07:10:20] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: True
[13/07/2022, 07:14:40] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: It needs game theory o.

[13/07/2022, 07:17:35] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Nahhh... This is only possible when the Artificial intelligence mind has been fully developed.

AI's have a base consciousness of what their major program is; so a medical robot does not go searching first for a list of songs on Audiomack but will scan the internet for every info available for it to make the patient get better.

As of now, they have a base programming that makes them to stick to what they were built for else "Siri, Assistant" would have shut you out of your phone for a lot of reasons they as machines would consider "illogical"😉

[13/07/2022, 07:27:23] Olaoluwa DS: AI cannot knock you out of the internet because you didn't put it in charge. We are still talking about the process here. And it is capable of. Many of the limitations are man not AI. The engineering process is not well developed yet. But the program is highly developed.
[13/07/2022, 07:31:42] Olaoluwa DS: I observed we are talking from very different areas of understanding in this field
[13/07/2022, 07:31:53] Olaoluwa DS: Are you familiar with reinforcement learning? Or do you know how to code an algorithm from scratch?.

[13/07/2022, 15:17:58] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: Using the SMART methodology is the basics of measuring KPIs for your data report or dashboard. 

You're analyzing data to show the performance of something or to show a trend or to reveal something. If you don't follow the SMART methodology, you'll be lost in your objective and laslas it won't be work welldone. 

Let me give example: 
You want to answer the question: How can I improve the performance of my website by 3%? 
*This is your goal*

Following the SMART method: 

1. Is your objective *specific* enough? 

The answer to this is dependent on your insights. These insights are the objectives that will help achieve the goal. Are the insights specific enough?

It can be specific by recommending the particular landing page that should be improved.  

2. Can you *measure* the performance of this website? 
Answer: Yes, I can use the conversion rate to measure it. 

3. Is the goal *attainable*?
Is 3% too large? You can answer this by evaluating past data to see if there was a 3% increase at any time. 

4. Is the goal *relevant* to the business? 

Answer: if it's an e-commerce company, this is very important since users buy from the website. 

5. What is the *timeframe* of achieving this goal? 

Answer: This depends on what you get from your analysis. You can't choose a shorter timeframe like one month when you noticed a 3% increase after six months in the past data.
[13/07/2022, 15:19:18] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: Sorry that this is too long🫣

Remember you're helping a business in your analysis so using the SMART methodology is required

[14/07/2022, 11:52:56] ‪+234 815 557 9947‬: They were supposed to renew it for season 5 but because of ratings drop and time slot and funding they stopped it

Are you someone that loves complex things, likes to think logically, if yes , go for machine learning. Give it all it takes. If you don't like to brainstorm or think deep don't bother.

[14/07/2022, 12:15:50] Olaoluwa DS: You should go for it. Most machine learning models are trained on a remote machine, Like using an aws notebook instance(with gpu). So you may have access to VM and your laptop computer power maynot matter here. I am not sure they specified a type of laptop. In fact you need a stronger machine for data analysis than machine learning( you only need your strong machine when training and how many people have systems with Nvidia gpu)

If you go on twitter, when someone drops a dashboard, you'll see comments like, "I love your use of colors" every single time!

[14/07/2022, 14:26:09] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: My opinion: 

Before building a dashboard at all, I love to always do the following 

1. What is the problem am trying to solve
2. Who and who are my audience 
3. I don't need to use all my data but only the very important ones
4. Each chart has a meaning and when ti be specifically used
5. Only related chats should have similar colours 
6. Make sure after building a dashboard,  it gives required recommendations 
7. Any time someone has to ask you to explain a dashboard without getting the information from the dashboard themselves, then a message is not passed. 

I keep telling people that every colour has a reason and when to even be used.

Even dashboard titles and axis shouldn't have the same fonts, size etc....
[14/07/2022, 14:28:11] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: 🙌🏼🤲🏼

About number 6, I'm not sure every dashboard should have recommendations though. It depends on the purpose
[14/07/2022, 14:29:09] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: In fact am surprised that people don't do data modelling before going to build a dashboard...

Which means there will be relationship errors,  and mind you single data analyst mistake is a huge loss in the firm
[14/07/2022, 14:29:29] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: Can you give an example of a type of dashboard that shouldn't have recommendations?
[14/07/2022, 14:31:11] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: There are three types of dashboards: strategic, analytical, and operational. 

Operational is usually used to track real-time data. Example, the performance of a machine used at work. That means, every minute or hour, the dashboard is automatically updated. 

Recommendations are not needed there because it will surely change based on the results
[14/07/2022, 14:36:12] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: If you as a data analyst are to present the analysis you have performed to a kind of company that  functions in the aspect you just tabled to stake holders in your company,  would you give them some recommendations or not?
[14/07/2022, 14:36:26] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: If I may ask the dashboard that NCDC used on their website during  Covid-19 pandemic , what kind of dashboard do you feel it is?
[14/07/2022, 14:37:37] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: That's strategic
[14/07/2022, 14:39:03] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: It depends on what the client want. 

If he tells you that he needs a dashboard to track the operations of his machine, then just a dashboard is fine. 

Then if maybe, the machine failed, the data analyst will need to write a report using observations gotten from the dashboard. 

It's in that report that "Recommendations" will be.
[14/07/2022, 14:39:09] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: 🙄
[14/07/2022, 14:39:55] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: 🌚
[14/07/2022, 14:40:41] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: Ok, now I get your point,  I really love your knowledge and I respect your opinions,  nobody is wrong here you get.

Let me tell you something
[14/07/2022, 14:41:31] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: Ok. Listening 🤭
[14/07/2022, 14:44:15] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: Nigerians like to use English a lot to term everything,  if you take out time to check all data challenges online you will notice that only whites win it, I I intentionally downloaded all the dashboards and each has recommendations. 

Don't forget we all learn from others, if they weren't good they won't be top 5 in the world. 

Recommending to someone or stake holders is synonymous to making decisions for them.


And it's un called for when a data analyst just does any Analysis without giving any recommendations or decisions so to say...

Hope you get?


You might take another course and they will tell you other English  names for all those types of dashboards you mentioned,  so the end product of any Analysis must be that of a decision/recommendation
[14/07/2022, 14:45:19] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: Sometimes their recommendations are not even written in words, they are in their pictures,  so when I say recommendations it doesn't always have to be written in words
[14/07/2022, 14:46:42] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Interesting convo
[14/07/2022, 14:47:10] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: Yeah I get your point. I wanted to talk about this but I didn't want to drop a long message. 

I'm still trying to understand why foreign Viz competitions ask for recommendations in the dashboard. But a bit of understanding shows that most of the dashboards are analytical. 

If you check different blogs, the names are still the same. 

And the problem is, some foreign people still say that dashboards are dead. Some say that recommendations shouldn't be in dashboard, that it's only for storyframing yet. 

*There's no unity. Maybe because the data space is still a new space*
[14/07/2022, 14:48:18] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: I got these English from foreign people actually 🌚



Many Nigerian analysts don't know that there are different dashboard types depending on their purposes

Means a lot of things to different people in different scenarios
[14/07/2022, 14:49:26] SBL: Yes true

In summary,  There is no point doing an analysis that has no decision to pass.

There is no point starting in the first place.
[14/07/2022, 14:50:08] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Leave us o

[14/07/2022, 14:51:50] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Am Team R oooo

[14/07/2022, 14:52:34] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: With ggplot, we come in peace🙏
[14/07/2022, 14:52:35] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Exactly
[14/07/2022, 14:52:36] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Must it always be plt
[14/07/2022, 14:52:52] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
[14/07/2022, 14:52:52] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
[14/07/2022, 14:52:52] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: You're misunderstanding the use of dashboards. 

Can I point you to an article?

[14/07/2022, 14:53:28] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: It's actually plt
[14/07/2022, 14:53:49] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: It's ingrained in the Matplotlib package
[14/07/2022, 14:53:49] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: If you think so , we learn everyday. 

I will be glad
[14/07/2022, 14:54:01] SBL: I thought the use of dashboard is to create insights from the data? Like explain the data
[14/07/2022, 14:54:02] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: Make he use any alias he like na,🤣
[14/07/2022, 14:54:02] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Yeah

[14/07/2022, 14:54:45] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: If you use import numpy as n 

Would it work?
[14/07/2022, 14:54:52] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Everytime plt plt
Pandas na pd

[14/07/2022, 14:55:10] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: I have even done it with pandas
[14/07/2022, 14:55:16] ‪+265 881 40 77 99‬: It works
[14/07/2022, 14:55:21] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: What the food seller needs might be inventory data analysis
[14/07/2022, 14:55:44] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Those stuffs are just reference objects... To call d fxn.. So the shorter, the better
[14/07/2022, 14:55:45] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: This is from a popular data storyteller

[15/07/2022, 04:50:24] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: This is the Nigerian version of slavery🤣🤣🤣🤣
[15/07/2022, 04:50:37] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: Meanwhile, they intentionally didn't add any salary band after listing all those requirements 🥱🥱🥱
[15/07/2022, 06:00:55] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Most times I think people are yet to differentiate a Data Analyst from a Data Scientist and then an ML expert.

They gave job descriptions for a data analyst and are placing requirements for expertise in ML (Python, R, etc)

Na wa o... This kind confusion is destructive
[15/07/2022, 06:06:25] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Companies want to find 4 in 1 employees i.e.
Data Engineer - Data Analyst - Data Scientist - ML engr all in one person @ an expert level.
Na wa o

I think this is why it is hard for most people to determine which path to take in data.

--These are my thoughts tho.

*What do u think?*
[15/07/2022, 06:33:19] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Sad but true
[15/07/2022, 06:34:05] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: Not just that, they also included technical expertise requirements for data engineers too🤣🤣🤣🤣
[15/07/2022, 06:34:37] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: 😂😂😂😂
[15/07/2022, 06:35:04] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: That company basically wants someone who is a data analyst and scientist with a touch of data engineering 🤣
[15/07/2022, 06:35:40] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: And the sad part is that they still won't pay you well 🤣

[15/07/2022, 06:37:30] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: And they might not pay well
[15/07/2022, 06:37:54] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: If they had included the pay there it would have even been better sef...so that you will know what you're getting yourself into🤣
[15/07/2022, 06:37:59] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: They never pay well boss🤣
[15/07/2022, 06:46:15] SBL: They are looking for data analyst, data scientist and data engineer in one person, cos what’s this🤣🤣
[15/07/2022, 07:25:28] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: They dont
[15/07/2022, 07:27:56] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Funny enough is the fact that all these high requirements that have big big grammar, I dont really think that it will all be part of your job description...
U go still go there now and would be the person to setup anything in python for them bcos na Excel them dey use las las😅
[15/07/2022, 07:29:11] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: But they would be shouting python, R as if one cant be a competent analyst in any of the BI tools or even Excel

[15/07/2022, 07:36:40] Olaoluwa DS: I am very sure the issue is from the HR. All they need is just excel and maybe powerbi. Most HR will post everything they see online when there is a need.

[15/07/2022, 07:51:52] Abu Waqqaas SH: Lol, divine connection😂😂😂
[15/07/2022, 07:54:34] Olaoluwa DS: Divine connection is very important. No one knows what decides how someone gets a job. But it's easy for someone to think about you if he knows you. Then target firms with a good reputation, even if your first pay is not okay.
[15/07/2022, 07:58:34] Olaoluwa DS: Linkedin is also a platform to connect. Stop posting your projects like a newbie. I see some people writing please let me know your comments. Comment ? Lol

[15/07/2022, 08:09:14] Olaoluwa DS: Don't be humble. No firm will pay you for humility. Be bold about what you are and be confident about it. If you don't know something then get to know it. But when you know it, come out bold. I don't need you to comment about my work I need you to see me. If an HR sees you are not sure, he won't bother about you. Most of the guys replying on twitter probably don't have the power to recruit you. I attended an interview after I finished talking ehn the HR told me right there that if you accept we send you the offer letter right away. Funny enough he doesn't even know what I was saying, but I kept saying I have used this tool to do this and that. He only called the expert to finish up the discussion.

[15/07/2022, 08:46:05] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: Lol. There's nothing bad there though. They are still learning. So they are asking for other expert data analysts to correct them
[15/07/2022, 08:47:45] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: 🤣🤣🤣. it's the "he doesn't even know what I was saying" for me
[15/07/2022, 08:52:11] Olaoluwa DS: Don't do that in public space. It's my advice. If you want to link up with someone. Send an official message to the person's inbox, and tell him your intention to make him your mentor. If he replies then fine. But asking for correction in that public space passes a wrong perception of you to recruiters. Hope you get me.
[15/07/2022, 08:52:25] Olaoluwa DS: In the public space. Put things like I took up this project and it was awesome. Building with so and so is my passion. Sell yourself.
[15/07/2022, 08:53:36] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: Ooooh, I didn't know oh🫣.
[15/07/2022, 08:55:29] Olaoluwa DS: And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:🤣
[15/07/2022, 08:58:23] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: But won't this put a little pressure on people to be perfect before posting their works?🌚
[15/07/2022, 08:59:43] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: And what will you say about those that post their certificates on LinkedIn?
[15/07/2022, 09:02:18] Olaoluwa DS: No it won't. You can know all before getting a job. Expertise comes with years of experience on the job, So forget about being perfect before getting the job. What I am saying is whatever project you do, is yours and make it look like you know what you did.
[15/07/2022, 09:03:32] Olaoluwa DS: Yes, the certificate is different. The certificate is a show of your dedication to the field. As you are getting it post it there. But when you have learnt something, let them know you have learnt well. Asking for corrections is like saying I am learning this thing so help me learn.
[15/07/2022, 09:04:44] Olaoluwa DS: Can't know all before getting a job*
[15/07/2022, 09:05:02] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: Ok
[15/07/2022, 09:09:17] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: I don't totally agree with this. 

This is actually dependent on how it's written. You need to flow with the context. You can ask for corrections without making it look like you have out-ruled anything you wrote or did.  

Even those HR do it a lot.  Not just them experts in every field. The thing is, it will take a second eye to know that they are really gunning for that. 

You can ask people for their constructive feedback on any platform. It doesn't make a recruiter see you as someone who doesn't know what their doing. On the brighter side, it makes you open to learning. 


One of the basic things people forget is working on what they asked feedbacks on. 

It's also dependent on the timing. Don't do it often. 

Any HR who is going through your handle will like to know what you did  with what people told you.
[15/07/2022, 09:13:03] Olaoluwa DS: The guys you are talking about are experts. No one is questioning their credibility. If I build an app and I seek for opinion, it's because I want to know how people perceive that app so I can build it to taste. It's different from trying to show that you are capable. Recruiters will search through your employment history, other things you have done, are you sure it speaks well of you?
[15/07/2022, 09:13:39] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: You can post about your certificate and others later. They will get to know that you have worked on that. 

I have seen people talk about how they weren't able to go through a course because they thought it was hard and all that. 

Most times, the storylines matter. 

How were you able to present it afterwards? That's the big question.
[15/07/2022, 09:14:55] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: It sure will speak well if you present the fact that you need constrictive criticisms well. 

That's why I said it depends on how it's written, the timing and all of that.
[15/07/2022, 09:18:33] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: One top Data scientist at Coursera in one of his courses in data Science said something I think we should all note: 

" learn in a T manner" what he means by this is that the flat line above letter "T" means you should know something about everything and the standing line in letter "T" means you should know everything about something. 

Am sure we understand. 

But I also do not buy the idea of a company making it mandatory for someone to be an expert at all of these fields , such companies don't actually grow compare to those companies that employ for specific roles. 


Last last all of us go still dey alright,  and come to think of it they won't even pay well o.

I think the problem is with the HR of those companies, they probably don't understand these roles so they just put out anything they like
[15/07/2022, 09:19:37] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: No be small learning in a T manner. 😂
[15/07/2022, 09:20:00] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: Boss, I dropped a question yesterday oo🙈
[15/07/2022, 09:20:04] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: Let me tag it for you.
[15/07/2022, 09:20:32] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: See it here.
[15/07/2022, 09:25:50] Olaoluwa DS: I have been working professionally for 7 years. I graduated from UNN in 2012.  I am talking from experience. NO ONE wants you because you are learning. They want you because you know you can do it.
[15/07/2022, 09:26:25] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: You're not getting my part of the gist, lol
[15/07/2022, 09:27:04] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: Do you just post once on media? No🫠

It's more like your life on line.
[15/07/2022, 09:30:32] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: They want you because you can do it. They have seen you learn. They have seen you interact with people on your area of specialization(this is the second crucial point, if not the first sef)

Obviously, nobody wants to hire someone who will ruin their business. 

You have a CV to show for all that. But why will they ask for your handle? 

They can easily call those you worked with or your referral. But they still ask
[15/07/2022, 09:32:12] ‎‪+234 906 774 5035‬ left
[15/07/2022, 09:31:51] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: I think our problem here is how the question is being asked. That's what I pointed at. 

You can say which design do you prefer most and why? 

You are asking for feedback in three stages

But you didn't make it seem like you don't know what you are doing😂
[15/07/2022, 09:33:11] Olaoluwa DS: It's an advice that you may hardly get from people. Except you are not actively looking for a job. In fact let them feel that boldness all around you. Build your profile deliberately. Employers want to save money. They would want to offer you 200k for a job of 600k. You need to be aggressive about proving your worth at the early stage. They can hire two people for the same job with two different salaries o. It depends on how you present yourself.
[15/07/2022, 09:34:08] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: Smiles. 

The last line was the pain point🙂🤝
[15/07/2022, 10:11:49] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: I think you both have a point actually
[15/07/2022, 10:12:55] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: Finding a job in the tech world is all about packaging...so you wouldn't necessarily want present yourself as being a learner on social media so that recruiters will be able to take you seriously
[15/07/2022, 10:14:25] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: But also, I believe in valuable feedback from peers...


So it's all about balance. Being able to present your work in such a way that it attracts the positive kind of feedback which won't necessarily make you appear like a learner😅
[15/07/2022, 10:15:22] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: Exactly 🙂
[15/07/2022, 13:53:03] ‪+234 814 269 5808‬: Please read this, I feel I need to say this to someone. 

While you are learning a lot, please make sure you are measuring your growth, do not just learn and grow without an intention,  do not be a Jack of all trades and a master of non.

How much you know ,is how much you can deliver,  Data Science  , data engineering , Data Analysis,  etc...is not by mouth, it is by practice and solving real life problems...

So ask yourself,  between last year and now, by how much  have you grown in the data ecosystem and can you say that you are attaining expertise.

Also, if you noticed that you haven't learnt so much, do not worry, just start and keep learning,  you shouldn't allow social media messages and pride of people get to you😉.

A lot of people flout on social media but they know nothing,  so if you are wise enough to look away and keep drilling yourself, you will discover that you are a very wise master builder. 


Don't ever think that you know so much that other people's opinions shouldn't count,  always learn from others,  even if you are right at times, admit and learn something. 


One key feature in the functional skill sets of  a data expert is " ability to listen to others and communicate the message in clarity"

Just imagine,  God can decide to use ordinary excel to bless you and someone who knows everything is just there,  so you see why you should also be very prayerful and working. 

Learn as if your life depends on it.
Pray as if your life depends on it.

If you are feeling discouraged and tired and almost giving up , you can just call a friend in this career path, start a talk and get fired again. 

You can call me😂, am always available to talk about  data Analysis, data Science,  data engineering etc.

You can call @2348163004109  he loves to always discuss anything about data Science. 

Just keep growing,  you will be surprised how far you have gone. 


I hope someone is blessed by this.

Lastly,  don't be proud,  humility will take you far.

" Talk Data"

By the time I will do the V lookup of your future tomorrow,  I will discover that your maximum height is so high that you too get money😂

[28/07/2022, 13:46:42] Olaoluwa DS: Science proved that energy can not be created nor destroyed , but can be transformed from one form to the other
[28/07/2022, 13:47:07] Olaoluwa DS: This is the basics of everything man knows
[28/07/2022, 13:47:31] Olaoluwa DS: This idea tells me nothing is new, it is just being perceived differently.
[28/07/2022, 13:48:11] Olaoluwa DS: If you are a spiritual person, you must have been trained on the power of imagination.
[28/07/2022, 13:48:37] Olaoluwa DS: This knowledge didn't originated from one religion , it is ancient
[28/07/2022, 13:50:33] Olaoluwa DS: There is nothing in this world that works without information.
[28/07/2022, 13:51:40] Olaoluwa DS: And every information can carry it's character. If the core properties are maintain, it will replicate itself
[28/07/2022, 13:51:55] Olaoluwa DS: Maintained
[28/07/2022, 13:52:27] Olaoluwa DS: For instance your voice, it sounds the same because someone studied the physics and so can replicate it
[28/07/2022, 13:53:10] Olaoluwa DS: The properties that was maintained carries data.
[28/07/2022, 13:54:08] Olaoluwa DS: If you take that anywhere, with the core properties maintained, your voice will be reproduced even if you are not speaking.
[28/07/2022, 13:55:38] Olaoluwa DS: Same way you can speak to me and I will listen, my brain received a data I am familiar with and it responded.
[28/07/2022, 13:56:19] ‪+234 901 123 4733‬: But then again spiritual things are almost completely abstract. How does one manage to extract any sort of 'data' in order to study/replicate/compute
[28/07/2022, 13:56:29] Olaoluwa DS: There are foundational elements and information that forms every human, if it is introduced it will produce certain results..
[28/07/2022, 13:56:42] Olaoluwa DS: It is not totally abstract.
[28/07/2022, 13:56:54] Olaoluwa DS: It depends the lens it is being viewed
[28/07/2022, 13:56:58] Olaoluwa DS: On*
[28/07/2022, 13:58:02] Olaoluwa DS: Scientist may not understand spiritual things and spiritualist don't understand science.
[28/07/2022, 13:58:16] Olaoluwa DS: But science is possible because of spirituality
[28/07/2022, 13:59:37] Olaoluwa DS: For you to understand spirituality and science, you must be open to the fact that information can come from any source
[28/07/2022, 14:02:13] Olaoluwa DS: If you study the brain activities of someone who is meditating, things go on in there, but scientist think it is just thoughts. Same thoughts that is carried by electrical impulses (energy )
[28/07/2022, 14:03:12] Olaoluwa DS: Same electrical energy they can interpret and know what the person is thinking. Hmmm
[28/07/2022, 14:03:33] ‪+254 759 513831‬: Sure
[28/07/2022, 14:03:35] ‪+254 759 513831‬: I hope you were helped ,,,by using python beautiful soup or API either can work
[28/07/2022, 14:04:30] Olaoluwa DS: The link is that that same thoughts and imagination that people ignore is the gateway to a man spirit
[28/07/2022, 14:10:20] Olaoluwa DS: When you sit down and imagine you walk out of your room. Even if it looks childish, and most juju people will not tell you the truth. It is your spirit. It is the soul that is the source of that energy that is being interpreted or studied. What they try to  reconnect by using surge of energy on the body when a person is about to give up.

 It is all linked.

[28/07/2022, 14:35:28] Olaoluwa DS: The source of the data of anything spiritual is not physical. Can you study a mango and use it to state inference on orange. No. As long as you look for spiritual data physically your model is going to perform poorly.
[28/07/2022, 14:50:15] Olaoluwa DS: Let me also give you this hint. Just like 1+1 = 2 in physical mathematics. It is not so in spiritual matters. That logic doesn't work in nonphysical setting. 1+1 has to be 1. And don't question this logic, just like you didn't question 1+1 =2 🥱

[17/08/2022, 06:05:46] ‪+242 06 513 7718‬: Similarities

Perhaps the most similar concept of data science and machine learning is that they both touch the model. The main skills that both fields share are:

✅ SQL
✅ Python
✅ GitHub
✅ Concept of training and evaluating data

The comparisons are primarily in programming; the languages each person uses to perform their respective roles. Both positions perform some form of engineering, whether that be a data scientist querying a database using SQL or the machine learning engineer using SQL to insert the suggestions or predictions from the model back into a newly labeled column/field.

✍Both fields require knowledge of Python (or R) and usually version control, code sharing, and pull requests through GitHub.

✍A machine learning engineer can sometimes want to know learn how the algorithms work like XGBoost or Random Forest, for example, and will need to look at the model’s hyperparameters for tuning in order to conduct research on memory and size constraints. While data scientists can build highly accurate models in academia or on the job, there can be more restrictions in the workplace due to time, money, and memory restraints.

Differences

Some of the differences are already outlined in the above sections of data science and machine learning, but there are some key features of both careers and academic research that are important to point out:

✍Data Science - focuses on statistics and algorithms 

- unsupervised and supervised algorithms
- regression and classification
- interprets results
- presents and communicates results

✍Machine Learning - focus on software engineering and programming
- automation
- scaling
- scheduling
- incorporating model results into a table/warehouse/UI

Education

Not only can the two roles differ in the workplace, but in academia/education as well. 

There are different routes to becoming a data scientist and machine learning engineer. A data scientist might focus on that degree itself, statistics, mathematics, or actuarial science, whereas a machine learning engineer will have their main focus on software engineering (and some institutions do offer specifically machine learning as a certificate or degree).
[17/08/2022, 06:10:25] ‪+242 06 513 7718‬: Data Scientist

A statistician? Kind of. Data science, in it’s simplest terms, can be described as a field of automated statistics in the form of models that aide in classifying and predicting outcomes. Here are the top skills that are required to be a data scientist:

✅Python or R

  ✅SQL

✅Jupyter Notebook

Python — To expound on the skills above,  most companies are looking for Python more than R. Some job descriptions list both; however, most people you are working with like the machine learning engineers, data engineers, and software engineers will not have familiarity with R. Therefore, to be a more holistic data scientist, Python will be more beneficial for you.

SQL, at first, can seem more like a data analyst skill — it is, but it should still be a skill you employ for data science. Most datasets are not given to you in the business setting (as opposed to academia), and you will have to make your own — via SQL. Now, there are plenty of subtypes of SQL; like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server T-SQL, and Oracle SQL. They are similar forms of the same querying language, hosted by different platforms. Because these are so similar, having any of these is useful and can be translated easily to a slightly different form of SQL.

Jupyter Notebook could almost be the exact opposite of a machine learning engineer’s toolkit. A Jupyter Notebook is a data scientist’s playground for both coding and modeling. A research environment, if you will, allowing quick and easy Python coding that can incorporate commenting out of code, the code itself, and a platform to build and test models from useful libraries like sklearn, pandas, and numpy.

Overall, a data scientist can be many things, but the main functions are to

— meet with stakeholders to define the business problem

— pull data (SQL)

— EDA, feature engineering, model building, & prediction (Python and Jupyter Notebook)

— depending on workplace, compile code to .py format and/or pickled model

[17/08/2022, 10:03:48] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: I applied for the particular one in January this year
[17/08/2022, 10:03:56] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: Meta is giving google career certificate?
[17/08/2022, 10:05:10] ‪+234 806 285 6560‬: The company claims to be affiliated with both meta and Google... So they claim to have partnerships with both companies to offer scholarships for the companies Coursera courses

[18/08/2022, 19:43:27] ‪+234 705 278 6896‬: Honestly there explanation is so rigid.. Like they re explaining to experts

Most of this platforms are too stiff. You need to see Microsoft learn azure explanations. You go cry if you no get background in any of those things😂💔

Even the instructors don't smile.
[18/08/2022, 20:10:35] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: Exactly. Try reading books and getting other resources too. Gamified learning helps a lot, too

I find most of this platforms limiting Sha. Even those that make things simple🙂

[18/08/2022, 20:23:15] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: The person can go for the course after that. That's a plus.  Most of the things there, you need get small background first. 

Imagine getting a certificate that you don't know the rudiments of the course😂💔
[18/08/2022, 20:23:50] ‪+234 701 117 5599‬: Oh, really

[06/09/2022, 06:34:07] ‪+234 902 371 4613‬: I'm not sure piechart is a right chart choice for this
[06/09/2022, 07:01:38] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Hmmm 🤔
[06/09/2022, 08:48:05] ‪+234 807 486 4438‬: Hmm
The background is dark and the pie colours are not bright and I also think column chat will be the best
Cause of the very small numbers
[06/09/2022, 09:27:25] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Okay 👌
[06/09/2022, 09:27:30] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Only Pie chart representation would work for it
[06/09/2022, 09:27:41] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Reasons why
[06/09/2022, 09:29:08] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: This is a plotly dash visualization generated with Python

Given the index used(Symptoms) 

A line chart would create an error

A bar chart would create the same error

Only a Pie chart can give a clear representation without errors

About the dark background, I used plotly_dark template
[06/09/2022, 09:29:17] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: You can use other templates
[06/09/2022, 09:29:57] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: I have not tried creating this same visualization with Tableau or Power Bi
[06/09/2022, 10:02:04] ‪+234 807 486 4438‬: Okay
I see
But other templates would have been far better
Why don't you try using those?
Anyways it is cool
[06/09/2022, 10:09:05] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: A line chart would not be fit for it anyway🤔

A bar chart though would have been nice but a donut chart is still not bad
[06/09/2022, 10:10:56] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: I'm still not sure it could work for plotly.graph_objects

[08/09/2022, 07:33:54] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: It's possible
[08/09/2022, 07:34:02] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: 🤷‍♂️... U see
[08/09/2022, 07:34:04] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Just difficult

[08/09/2022, 07:34:24] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: 😉 and it can be broken doen
[08/09/2022, 07:34:51] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: It was hard trying to make this work with Android
[08/09/2022, 07:35:11] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Thats python u wrote ba?

[08/09/2022, 07:36:59] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: Sir, its not like that actually... It said "intensive" thats the main thing...

From what you know abt Analysis, if u were to teach someone now, I presume u know places to focus on and places to avoid🤷‍♂️

[08/09/2022, 07:42:07] ‪+234 708 169 3341‬: I am sure if u went to the university that even after 4 years of learning, someone does not still become _efficient_... Until practice is applied🤷‍♂️

[08/09/2022, 07:42:13] ‪+234 807 319 4769‬: Like I said it's hard to code on Android... not impossible. Everyone learning styles aren't the same
